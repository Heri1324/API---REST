The application allows you to connect to the ESP32 board using Bluetooth Classic or Bluetooth Low Energy.

The app requires the Bluetooth module and location services to be enabled on the smartphone, as well as several permissions to access Bluetooth specific functions, such as scanning for devices, connecting and advertising.

The application will ask for the location permission, which is necessary for Bluetooth Low Energy in order to complete a scan. It does NOT extract or use your location in any way.

The requests and responses are specific for each project category and are detailed in the following sections.
